## Titanic Survival Prediction
## Problem Statement
The Royal Mail Steamer (RMS) Titanic shipwreck resulted in 1502 deaths from among the 2224
passengers and crew. It was observed that some people have higher chances of survival than others. The task
is to build a predictive model to identify people who are more likely to survive.
## Dataset
The dataset used for this problem is the Kaggle dataset “Titanic - Machine Learning from
Disaster”. The dataset has been split into two parts: train.csv and test.csv. The training set which includes the
ground truth as well can be used to build the model. This train.csv is further split into sets for training and
testing. The dataset contains around 891 rows and 12 columns out of which only some are relevant for our
analysis and some contains missing values. From the initial analysis, around 70 percent of women survives
and only around 20 percent of men survive the shipwreck. Also, passengers in the lower age group have a
higher probability of survival. We need to clean and prepare the data before we can build the model to learn
other interesting relationship between the data.
